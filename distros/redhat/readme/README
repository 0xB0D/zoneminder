What's New
==========

1. See the ZoneMinder release notes for a list of new features:
     https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/releases

2. The contents of the ZoneMinder Apache config file have changed. In
   addition, this ZoneMinder package now requires you to manually symlink the
   ZoneMinder Apache config file. See new install step 6 and upgrade step 3
   below for details.

3. This package has been split into sub-packages to allow compatibility with
   other web servers. Here is a breakdown of the available packages:

     zoneminder - Meta-package installs zoneminder-common and zoneminder-httpd
                  This exists soley for backwards compaitilibty.
     zoneminder-common - Common files that do not differ based on the web server
     zoneminder-httpd - Files needed for compatibility with the Apache web server
     zoneminder-nginx - Files needed for compatibility with the Nginx web server

   You can switch between different subpackages with dnf/yum. Be advised that,
   if you modified any of the default config files supplied by the package,
   rpm may not update the config file to the proper version. This is by design.
   Use drop-in files instead, to avoid this issue.

4. Continue on to the next README that corresponds to the chosen webserver:

     README.httpd - Follow these steps when using Apache
     README.nginx - Follow these steps when using Nginx
