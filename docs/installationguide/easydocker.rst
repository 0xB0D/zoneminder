An Easy To Use Docker Image
===========================
If you are interested in trying out ZoneMinder quickly, user Dan Landon maintains an easy to use docker image for ZoneMinder. With a few simple configuration changes, it also provides complete Event Server and Machine Learning hook support. Please follow instructions in his repostory. He maintains two repositories:

* If you want to run the latest stable release, please use his `zoneminder repository <https://github.com/dlandon/zoneminder>`__.
* If you want to run the latest zoneminder master, please use his `zoneminder master repository <https://github.com/dlandon/zoneminder.master-docker>`__.

In both cases, instructions are provided in the repo README files.

If you are looking at making your own docker build of ZoneMinder instead, please refer to :doc:`packpack`.
